# Heavy Load and Light Load
In electrical and electronic systems, the terms heavy load and light load describe the amount of current drawn by a connected device or circuit.  
The distinction is based primarily on the load resistance and the resulting power consumption:

## Heavy Load (High Current, Low Resistance):

A heavy load occurs when the connected device has low resistance, allowing a large current to flow.
Such devices consume significant power and place greater demand on the source.
### Examples:
 - Electric motors
 - Heaters and ovens
 - Air conditioners
 - High‑wattage incandescent lamps

## Light Load (Low Current, High Resistance):

A light load occurs when the connected device has high resistance, which restricts current flow.
These devices consume less power and impose minimal demand on the source.
### Examples:
  - LED indicators
  - Small sensors (e.g., temperature or humidity sensors)
  - Low‑power microcontrollers
  - Mobile phone chargers

## Summary
Heavy load → low resistance → high current → high power consumption.  
Light load → high resistance → low current → low power consumption.
